This project maps voting results at precinct levels to census block groups. 

*Code*: The codes are included in the python script `PrecinctToBG.ipynb`.
 
*Input Data*: Data used in the code scripts can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1owbbjTNok5RDU4qaBuzQYzD9-yWKwnvO?usp=sharing. To run the code script `PrecinctToBG.ipynb`, the downloaded data folder should be put in the same path as the the code script. 
 
*Output Data*: The results can be seen in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aFCRDNrZHHoVdz1cKEFXb_dlbyFmZexw?usp=sharing. This is a block group level shapefile that contains the number of people who voted for different candidates in 2016 election.
