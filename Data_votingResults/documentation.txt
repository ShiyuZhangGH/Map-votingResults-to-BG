Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD.

Arkansas
--------
Election results from Arkansas Secretary of State (https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/research/election-results)

Precinct shapefile primarily from Jennifer Wheeler at the Arkansas GIS Office who provided an unreleased interim version of the statewide precinct shapefile with updated or corrected boundaries. Where noted below, the official 2016 shapefile release was used to reverse changes that followed the 2016 election.

Countywide votes were distributed for Calhoun, Fulton, Izard, Jefferson, Ouachita, Union. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct mergers were made in the following counties to match county reporting units: Ashley, Carroll, Chicot, Clark, Crittenden, Dallas, Faulkner, Hot Spring, Howard, Independence, Jackson, Mississippi, Monroe, Nevada, Ouachita, Poinsett, Phillips, St. Francis.

Additional modifications to reflect how election results were reported:

Howard: Mineral Springs ward boundaries from 2016 shapefile; Buck Range, Dillard, Nashville boundaries from 2016 shapefile
Izard: Sage in Melbourne 4 and Oxford in Brockwell split by township shapefile
Jackson: Newport JP 2, Newport JP 7, Tuckerman 2 from Justice of the Peace shapefile; R&I 7 omitted as it was not in use for 2016 general election
Jefferson: Precincts 6, 35, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 52, 63, 129, 402, 411 from 2016 shapefile

Sharp: Washington 1 and Washington 2 had no defined boundary; voters in Washington Township were given the option of 2 poll locations
St. Francis: Forrest City wards revised to match city PDF and legal description in municipal code
Stone: Ben 1 & Ben 2 split according to Secretary of State map; due to early vote reporting errors Fifty Six Precinct merged into Northwest Precinct and Foothills 1/Foothills 2 subprecincts merged together
Washington: Reversed Greenland City annexation based on 2016 shapefile

Precincts 17-02, 16-31, and 16-41 are the reporting units for UOCAVA votes (for New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Counties, respectively). These have no actual geography and the votes reported were not distributed to other precincts.

Precinct 13-02 appears in the shapefile, but not in election returns. However, the POPULATION column which came supplied in the shapefile reports 0 population.

Though the shapefile is labeled as the 2012 version, personal communication with the state office confirms that these will be in place throughout the decade.

Charlotte, Hendry, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Levy, Madison, and Walton Counties are from VTDs released by the Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Program.

Hernando 99, Collier 450, and Palm Beach 8001/8002 are UOCAVA precincts with no real geography and votes were not redistributed.

Precinct names were adjusted to align with the formatting used in the voter registration file (e.g., some precincts have leading spaces).

Precinct shapefile from the Michigan Department of State (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8ce0f3ce3ff74109ac02a26d34a0f4fc_1)

Michigan has cities split across counties. Two are relevant to their reported election results versus the precinct map (which did not make the split), Fenton and Richmond. Those precincts were merged to reflect the precinct map.

Most counties had "statistical adjustments" that were at the county level, rather than the precinct level. Only two were for party candidates (Huron and Kalkaka), and in those cases, two or fewer votes. The remaining cases were related to "other" votes. Due to the scattered nature of "other" votes, these votes are apportioned to precincts by the split of total votes of precincts within the county.

Detroit allows for absentee votes to be reported by Absentee Voter Counting Boards, which generally contain multiple precincts. These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the non-AVCB vote was split among precincts within a county. The linkage between election precinct and AVCB was provided by OpenElections via Derek Willis. Precinct 176 was listed as split between AVCB 37 and AVCB 158, the only precinct in the city that was listed as split. AVCB 158 has no other precinct assigned to it, so all votes went to precinct 176. However, this was a very low number of votes relative to the other AVCBs, so for ease of calculation, 176 was treated as a normal member of AVCB 37 in the disaggregation calculation described above.

Some counties reported one or more classes of votes at the county level. These were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote.

Write-in votes were inconsistently provided by the counties, so they were excluded. Unofficial precinct results from NE Secretary of State used as a cross-reference in places.

Election results from Nevada Secretary of State (https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information/precinct-level-results)

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties/city used maps sourced from the respective county governments instead: Carson City, Clark, Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Washoe.

Fragmented precincts in the Churchill County VTD shapefile were merged together. County boundaries were corrected in the Clark, Eureka, and Humboldt County shapefiles using the Census VTD shapefiles. Washoe County's shapefile did not have geography for Lake Tahoe, this was added in to give complete coverage of the state.

Countywide-reported votes for Carson City, Churchill, Clark, Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, Lyon, Nye, Pershing, Washoe, White Pine were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote. Clark County had congressional district-reported votes that were distributed in a similar fashion.

The state election results by precinct do not include precinct votes by candidate for precincts with less than 10 total votes cast. For Douglas and Washoe, these were transferred from the county precinct reports. For Churchill, Elko, Esmerelda, Humboldt, Lyon, Mineral, Nye, Pershing, Storey, and White Pine these were inferred from the countywide totals. Clark County was also inferred from countywide totals, but using additional party registration information as of Nov 5, 2016 with slight adjustments to match total ballots cast per precinct.

Oregon
------
Election results from the Oregon Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/). Results from Polk, Tillamook, Wallowa, and Wasco counties were corrected with the respective county reports.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were obtained from the following counties: Benton, Columbia, Coos, Crook, Curry, Deschutes, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath, Lane, Linn, Malheur, Morrow, Multnomah, Polk, Sherman, Tillamook, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wasco, Washington, Yamhill.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were provided by the Oregon Secretary of State's office for the following counties: Clatsop, Hood River, Jefferson, Marion. The Marion County shapefile included numerous gaps that were assigned based on the Precinct Split Summary report from the county clerk's office. Precincts along the Salem/Kaiser border were revised with the corrected municipal boundaries from the Marion County 2019 precinct shapefile.

The 2016 precinct shapefile for Clackamas County was provided by the Metro Regional Government Data Resource Center.

Precinct boundaries for Grant County and Wheeler County are defined by school district boundaries. Precinct shapefiles were produced to match PDF maps provided by the respective counties using the 2016 Oregon Education Boundaries shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were produced based on PDF maps provided by the respective counties: Baker, Gilliam, Lake, Lincoln. Boundaries defined by the PLSS grid were produced with the Oregon Public Land Survey Quarter-Quarter Reference Grid shapefile obtained from the Oregon spatial Data Library. Municipal boundaries were produced from the Oregon Department of Transportion 2016 City Limits shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Street boundaries are produced from the U.S. Census Bureau's census block shapefiles.

PDF maps obtained from Lake County are approximate precinct boundaries drawn on the PLSS grid for county precincts and on the street map for Lakeview city precincts. These boundaries were adjusted to match address range assignments in the Lake County Address Library Report which serves as the legal definition of the precincts according to the Lake County Clerk. Precinct divisions for roads that cross multiple rural precincts are generally defined by zip codes. Address ranges were further identified based on the Lake County tax lot parcel viewer.

Rural precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Coos County and Union County were revised to match the updated PLSS cadastral grid in the Oregon GIS Framework obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. 

Municipal precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Tillamook County and Umatilla County were revised to reverse annexations that were not yet in effect for the November 2016 general election. 

The boundaries of precincts 14, 37, 45, 49 in the Deschutes County shapefile were revised to match legislative district assignments.

Precinct numbers in the Columbia County, Josephine County, and Wallowa County shapefiles were corrected to match the Oregon Secretary of State voter file.
